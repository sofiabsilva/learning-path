# Profile Lookup Instructions

We have an array of objects representing different people in our contacts lists.

A lookUpProfile function that takes firstName and a property (prop) as arguments has been pre-written for you.

The function should check if firstName is an actual contact's firstName and the given property (prop) is a property of that contact.

If both are true, then return the "value" of that property.

If firstName does not correspond to any contacts then return "No such contact"

If prop does not correspond to any valid properties then return "No such property"
