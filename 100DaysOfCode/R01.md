### Day 1: April 30, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Doing the Practical JavaScript course on Watch and Code. Starting the HTML and DOM section today! I've been doing this course because I want to refresh my memory about JavaScript and really learn to think like a programmer to prepare me for future projects. This course has been recommended to me and it's very good so far. 

**Thoughts:** Got through some exercises that really helped me understand things I hadn't before. 
- How objects and primitives compare and how they're stored in variables.

Example: Here, the object's house color would not change to red! Using these diagrams helped to see the difference between primitive and reference values!

### Day 2: May 1, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the Practical JavaScript course. Learned a very useful tool that will surely help me with all of my projects. THE DEBUGGER! 

**Thoughts:** It's incredible how most javaScript courses don't teach how to actually apply it. Understanding how to interact with the HTML document is so important and so is understanding the chrome dev tools.  


### Day 3: May 2, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: I'm now at 72% on the Practical JavaScript course. Learned about refactoring, something I had never heard of before, all about making the code more readable and organized for humans! Also, not entirely related to coding but I got to watch a webinar titled "Acing Your Interview with Positive Psychology: Q&A with Nico Rose" by Dr. Nico Rose. A perks of being a Google Scholarship alumni!

**Thoughts:** 
About the webinar, I enjoyed it a lot. I've been very interested in Psychology recently (for about a year or so) and there are some tips that I'm going to try to calm myself and prepare for future job interviews. 

### Day 4: May 3, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't continue with the Practical JavaScript course due to technical issues with plnkr.co, so instead I continued with the Basic JavaScript section on #FreeCodeCamp just to refresh my memory on a few concepts. 

**Thoughts:** Not my most productive day.

### Day 5: May 4, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Practical JavaScript course and finished watching a Udacity webinar "Front-end Problem Solving and Debugging Skills with Cameron Pittman". Also read this noteworthy [article](https://medium.com/@samerbuna/the-mistakes-i-made-as-a-beginner-programmer-ac8b3e54c312) about Mistakes beginner programmers make and how to avoid them. 

### Days 6 & 7: May 5 & 6, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday I didn't get to dedicate 1 hour to coding, so I guess I already failed to do the 100 days streek. BUT today I dedicated more time to coding than yesterday to make up for it. Got to 82% on the Practical Javascript course. Got a better grasp at using functions inside other functions.

**Thoughts:** Even thought I failed the challenge on day 6, I still pushed myself to learn a bit on SoloLearn (doing the CSS course there), if I wasn't doing this challenge I probably wouldn't have thought about coding that day. 

### Day 8: May 7, 2018 
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: I'm now 90% into the Practical Javascript course. Understood how we distinguish between Higher Order Functions from the Callback Functions, when we have functions inside other functions.
![](https://s9.postimg.cc/3td31e5lb/Captura_de_ecr_de_2018-05-07_13-31-44.png)

I now truly understand how event listeners work and how the object and it's properties can be acessed when passing a parameter (ex. event) to the  callback function, for example: 
```
// In Chrome dev tools, when an element is selected on a page you can access it by using $0;
var selectedElement = $0;
  selectedElement.addEventListener ('click', function(event) {
  console.log(event);  
  });
// When that selected element is clicked, the mouseEvents object, which has many useful properties, is logged to the console.
``` 
I also learned about event delegation and why it is preferable to do that opposed to adding multiple of the same event listeners to every child.

**Thoughts:** Today I felt like I learned many new things that are small but important to fully understand JavaScript. Also, the todo list is now a bit more functional. 

### Day 9: May 8, 2018 
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Practical JavaScript Course. Continued with freecodecamp lessons and started a new small project a 'Mad Libs - Harry Potter edition', just for fun. By started I mean: Having the idea, creating the files and starting to write a bit of the HTML and CSS. 

**Thoughts:** The PJS course was pretty good for consolidating my previous knowledge of JS and also for understanding how some methods work and most importantly using the Chrome dev tools & debugger both for understanding what is happening and for fixing issues with the code. The last part of the course still needs reviewing though.

### Day 10: May 9, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the design, content and figuring out how to go about the functionality of the Mad Libs Harry Potter project. 

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I'll hopefully get some of the JS code done and working! Fingers crossed.

### Day 11: May 10, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building 

**Today's Progress**: Made input text live change the text on the page. Learned the difference between using ```getElementsByClassName("className")``` and ```querySelector(".className")``` - so the difference is, when you use ``` getElementsByClassName("className")```  it creates a nodeList (a special array of Nodes) of all elements in the page with that class name, so you'd have to use [0] after the () to correctly use that element. Thanks Google and SlackOverflow! 

**Thoughts:** I got so frustrated because I spent over an hour trying to make a single input change an elemnet on the page, when I hadn't loaded the js file correctly! TYPOS :( 
On top of that I'm feeling the flu coming my way!

### Day 12: May 11, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building 

**Today's Progress**: Practically finished the "Harry Potter Mad Libs" project!

**Thoughts:** Even though I was feverish I got to work on the project all day and it felt awesome to actually make progress for once! Might not be the ideal and most readable code ever but I tried to come up with everything on my own. 

### Day 13: May 12, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Testing & Learning

**Today's Progress**: I don't know how finished it is but I feel like it's at a good enough state that I can finish my Mad Libs project with the world! I then continued with a few Free Code Camp JS lessons as well.


[![harry-potter-mad-libs.png](https://s9.postimg.cc/68x13aq67/harry-potter-mad-libs.png)](https://sofiabsilva.github.io/mad-libs-harry-potter/)

**Thoughts:** Since yesterday I spent the whole day in front of the computer I made sure not to do that today, but I managed to stay productive with the little time I had planned for coding which is awesome. [Promodoro - Tomato Timer](https://tomato-timer.com/) for the win! 

### Day 14: May 13, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Reviewing & Learning

**Today's Progress**: Almost done reviewing the freeCodeCamp JS basics. 

**Thoughts:** I much prefer the format of the Udacity lessons or building things myself, but my goal with freeCodeCamp is to get a refresher on the basics and move on to the advanced Udacity courses, then doing their Algorithms & Projects to get the Front End Dev certification. I wonder if I should be doing this? I just felt so insecure about my JS abilities that I wanted to take on the beginner courses and learn more from different resources before getting myself into more advanced stuff. But I'm finding that I know a lot more than I thought I did, which is a good thing obviously!

### Day 15: May 14, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Reviewing & Learning

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the FCC JS lessons. Now I know what JSON refers to! Had been hearing about it for a long time but never really looked it up (well, at this stage I still won't need to use it but it's nice to know what it is). 

**Thoughts:** It's getting tricky to do the challenges, this last one really got me... It was the "Profile Lookup" one, the whole accessing objects with arrays on them and using nested loops and if else statements is really challenging.  

### Day 16: May 15, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Reviewing

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic Javascript Lessons on FCC. Started "Javascript and the DOM" on Udacity. Also learned how to [make folders](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Creating-new-folders-in-GitHub-repository-via-the-browser) in GitHub from the web browser interface, now I'm saving specific lessons/challenges from FCC for later reference.

**Thoughts:**  It was a good decision to take a look at the Udacity course, now I understand where specific methods and properties came from [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API).

### Day 17: May 16, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Planing & Learning

**Today's Progress**: I'm planing/designing my website for Tubbie Arts (for displaying my artwork) - basically it's going to be a custom wordpress theme. So It's gonna be a portfolio website that's a bit more elaborate than the one I've created before (this one will have different pages, and offer the ability to purchase my work). I'm learning more about Wordpress as well. Not so much actual coding today but as I learned previously planning should be part of the workflow of a programmer.

### Day 18: May 17, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't manage to do much. Only started writing the html and organizing sections for the Tubbie Arts website and looked for inspiration and cool ways to make a slideshow for the gallery. 

**Thoughts:** I think there is going to be a key thing missing from the aesthetic of the first version of the website at least, which is the lack of good quality photos of my drawings. Need to take new ones but I don't have a good camera! :sweat: 

### Day 19: May 18, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my gallery website, still no gallery to be seen but the design, menu, css and social media links are looking good-ish. 

**Thoughts:** Absolutely loving the pattern I'm using for the background. Found it on https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/

### Day 20: May 19, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the mobile version of the site (mobile first!) got the mobile menu working, wrote and designed the about page, got the portuguese version of the home and about page done.

**Thoughts:** I've been playing with the border-style properties, don't know if it will stay this way but I think it's interesting that you can use two types of styles in a single image (well actually we can use 4). 

![wip about tubbie arts page](https://s9.postimg.cc/5llt5yazz/about-wip.png)

### Day 21: May 20, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Just improved a few things on the design of the pages, made the thumbnails for the featured drawings and made the desktop nav bar appear (I started with the mobile version only). 

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately I didn't get the gallery working yet, I'm still weighting options for what to do with the gallery, link to another page when clicking on the thumbnails (where you can see bigger photo(s) of the drawing, information about it and prices for different sizes of prints to purchase? A paypal link for it? Or a simple lightbox type of gallery with the bigger pictures of the drawings with title, simple description and a link to buy it right there?  Now that I've written this out I think it'll be better to have individual pages for each drawing! This whole journaling thing is a great way to have a conversation with myself and clearly see the pros and cons of my ideas. 

### Day 22: May 21, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Using [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) implemented some smooth transitions between pages, made gallery overlay effect using [this example](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) as a guide.

**Thoughts:**  I feel so limited when it comes to JavaScript, I wonder how long till I feel confident enough to make my ideas come to life just like I imagined them. Well, it's not only JS, with CSS there are many things I still haven't understood... One of them is the absolute and relative positioning, and the other is the ::before and ::after things.

### Day 23: May 22, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Made a cross icon appear when closing the menu on mobile, added a new page for pricing and started working on it's content. 

### Day 24: May 23, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Continued styling the new pricing page (mainly the pricing table) with CSS and made a new (and last) page, which holds the contact form.

**Thoughts:** Will need to learn how to make the contact form work later on! Hope it's not too complicated... :anguished:
Also, I have Web Designer magazines at home and forgot all about them (they're my dad's)! Even though they're not very recent, most stuff is still up to date. So Yay for learning from a non screen medium. 

### Day 25: May 24, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Added icons and an active state to the nav bar, kept styling and updated some of the pages to match the others. Also updated my portfolio with the "Mad Libs" HP game.  

**Thoughts:** Note to self, before making a new page with the same content but with a different language make sure to be done (if it can ever be) before moving on to the other language pages, it saves time.

### Day 26: May 25, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Got mockup images for the individual pages of each gallery item, started trying them out with photoshop, did a few FreeCodeCamp lessons and continued styling the pages of the site.

**Thoughts:** Spent HOURS looking for frame mockups , found some cool psd ones for free at www.anthonyboyd.graphics ; https://www.freepik.com/ and https://graphicburger.com/ for this reason didn't get to code much.

### Day 27: May 26, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Today I did more design than coding again, had to edit some photos and mockups on photoshop still a lot to work on, my computer is super slow which is not helping.

### Day 28: May 27, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Basically same as yesterday! Still putting things together on photoshop and planing content for the website. Technically no real coding today... I'm aware that I'm failing the challenge but I'll keep going anyway, will add hard coding days after the 100th.

### Day 29: May 28, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**:  Continued working with photoshop. Started looking on how to publish my website without back-end knowledge. Watched tutorials on how to create wordpress themes and read a bunch of articles.

**Thoughts:** I [asked for advice on what to do on twitter](https://twitter.com/TubbieHead/status/1001137875155550208), as I was thinking of converting my files into a wordpress theme and then use it's plugins and database. And got a bunch of interesting opinions:

  - Use wordpress!  It's used so widely there are endless resources to learn from. Look up running wordpress locally using xampp or something and go from there.

  - Wordpress can be clunky to build custom with as a noob.
  
  - Learn a back end technology, it will open many doors. There’s a lot to learn but you can do so much with it.
  
  - Try @GoHugoIO if you want to focus only on frontend and dont want to get into other stuff right now.
  
  - Try FireBase! Hosting is free and easy to set up. WordPress might be worth learning, but it can also be a great hassle.

### Day 30: May 29, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**:  Spent most of the day looking into the different suggestions given yesterday and learning about basics of how to publish a website, what's hosting, servers etc. Also started looking into SEO techinques to apply when developing websites and pushed the website I've been working on to [this github repo](https://github.com/sofiabsilva/tubbie-arts-website), added some content to it as well.

**Thoughts:** Realised I was over complicating things. I already have a domain name and can host the site through my dad's host. I don't need any static site generator or CMS for this website since I'm the only one who'll be working on it.

### Day 31: May 30, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: I didn't make much progress today, just continuing to study SEO and work a bit on my website.

**Thoughts:** A month has passed and I feel like I've learnt a lot and acomplished a bunch of my goals since the start of the challenge. 

### Day 32: May 31, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on my website today, not much to report on... Just Added a new page and made the existing ones and new one more responsive.

**Thoughts:** I got a commission for a pet portrait, so I'm excited about that but also worried that it's going to leave me with little time to code. I'll always try to squeeze in an hour at least, but I bet there won't be much to report on.

### Day 33: June 1, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Kept adding pages & images to website. Finally all pages exist!

### Day 34: June 2, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the individual drawing pages, now started adding fitting descriptions.

**Thoughts:** Still need to see if the pricing is all correct, and look up what's the best paper and way to sell prints. Found out that I can add a shopping cart feature that goes directly to paypal, also seems like you can add shipping costs etc. But have to look more into that.

### Day 35: June 3, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Added ads for print studio where I'll get my prints done to every page, kept learning about the paypal business account.

### Day 36: June 4, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Add the paypal shopping cart integration to one of the pages (even though I don't have a business account yet, this is just a test at the moment). 

**Thoughts:** When is this going to end? I'm probably never gonna be 100% happy with the site, so now I just gotta re-check everything, work a bit more on the content and make sure things actually work.

### Day 37: June 5, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from working on the site, started the new lessons on freecodecamp, also watched a few webinars about career and e-commerce shops. Started my commissioned pet portrait.

**Thoughts:** I would count this day as a miss in terms of coding, but you gotta do what you gotta do right?

### Day 38: June 6, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress**: Learned about CSS variables on freecodecamp.

### Day 39: June 7, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress**: Continued the FCC lessons, it's mostly revision but I got a better understanding of relative and absolute positioning now.

### Day 40: June 8, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Created and translated portuguese page for the lynx drawing, added the portuguese version for the gallery and contact form too.

### Day 41: June 9, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to make the contact form work, will be using formspree for right now. But to upload photos I'll have to use an add on (all info is on formspree.io).

### Day 42: June 10, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress**: #FreeCodeCamp day! Got to learn how to make shapes and draw with CSS. 

### Day 43: June 12, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress**: Unfortunately missed a day yesterday, but today I've learned how to make animations using keyframes! Pretty cool stuff! Finished the applied visual design section on #freecodecamp

### Day 44 & 45: June 13 & 14, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Started the Applied Accessibility lessons on FCC and am appllying the learned principles to the website.

**Thoughts:** I'm finding this section very informative and interesting, learning so much! Will start to pay more attention to the design from now on, specially color choices. Will also have to tweak some of my older projects in regards to that.

### Day 46: June 15, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and building

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Applied Accessibility lessons on FCC and started working on the survey project. Already passed all the tests with HTML, so the fun part is coming up next! I'll try not to spend too much time choosing the color scheme...

### Day 47: June 16, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress**: Survey project complete! [view on codepen](https://codepen.io/Tubbie/live/RJLpJL) or check [this](https://github.com/sofiabsilva/Survey-FCC) repo.

### Day 48: June 17, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress**: Started building the Product Landing Page, another one of the required projects on FCC. HTML done. CSS next :D

### Day 49: June 18, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the product landing page #freeCodeCamp project. I still struggle to get headers with a logo on the left and a nav-bar on the right to display correctly. 

**Thoughts:** Twitter to the rescue! Sasha sent me this in response to my tweet, it's going to be good to compare the way it's made to what I have https://codepen.io/anon/pen/OEzXeN

### Day 50: June 19, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work on the FCC Product Landing Page project. Planning to finish it tomorrow or maybe later today if I have time.
 -Header ✔️
- 1st section ✔️
- color scheme & basic design ✔️

**Thoughts:** I'm halfway through the challenge! IS THIS REAL? I'm happy I started this, but I gotta say having to write my progress on here and twitter is a bit time comsuming, yet it also motivates me to get stuff done each day. 

### Day 51: June 20, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress**: Done with the Product Landing Page - #FreeCodeCamp project, except I still need to add a mobile friendly navigation burger, this will be a task for tomorrow.

![](https://postimg.cc/image/gez29l2dj/)

### Day 52: June 21, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress**: Couldn't do a lot today, but worked on the mobile version of the Product Landing Page, here it is on codepen:
https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/MXObze/

**Thoughts:** I hadn't actually tested the page on a real mobile, now I just saw how it looks on my phone and it's not displaying the burger icon correctly! Ooops. Also, as I'm writing this on another computer, which has a larger monitor, I'm seeing that there are still some things left to change on the page. I'd like to add more animations. 

### Day 53: June 22, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning/ Reviewing

**Today's Progress**: Didn't get to the computer the whole day so I reserved an hour and a half in the morning to use my phone instead and continued with the CSS Fundamentals course through the SoloLearn app.

### Day 54: June 23, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Fixing Stuff and Learning

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some design elements, animations (actually discovered you can't animate a color gradient background in CSS, after spending a good ammount of time refreshing and trying to catch my non-existent mistake) and the mobile non-responsiveness that I had done before on the [FCC Product Landing Page project](https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/MXObze/), also continued with the sololearn app.

**Thoughts:** Had an idea yesterday as I was listeing to the Syntax podcast, and so that I don't forget I'll write it here: It would be cool to keep up with bugs that take me a lot of time to solve and have a git repo or something like a blog where I post those bugs (even the missing semicolons and dumb mistakes that happen) and my process of solving them and understanding why/how they happen. 

### Day 55: June 24, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and Building

**Today's Progress**: Got to make some progress on #SoloLearn and started working on the remaining #freecodecamp responsive web design project "Technical Documentation Page" I'm doing one for the CSS Animations.

### Day 56: June 25, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and Building

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the FCC Technical Documentation Page project for a bit and then later got through some more CSS3 lessons on sololearn.

### Day 57: June 26, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and Building

**Today's Progress**: Continued builing the documentation page and completed the CSS Fundamentals course on SoloLearn!

### Day 58: June 27, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress**: Technical Doc Page project is done (I think). On codepen: https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/gKKVmB on github: https://sofiabsilva.github.io/CSS-Animations-Documentation-FCC/

**Thoughts:**  So happy to have discovered the scroll-behavior CSS property, I thought making this type of transition would require some CSS ninja skills but it was just a property! Thank you to FreeCodeCamp forum user mav1283, as I was inspired by his project in regards to the scrolling behavior, also helped me figure out how to do it myself. 

### Day 59: June 28, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress**: Continued improving the supposedly complete FCC technical doc page project. Added a way to pop the navigation up when needed on the mobile version. 

**Thoughts:** After wondering what was wrong for a while I learned you can't use z-index with an element with static position! Thanks google & stackoverflow!

### Day 60: June 29, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and Building

**Today's Progress**: Claimed my #freecodecamp [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/sofiabsilva/responsive-web-design) today! Improved a bit my portfolio, but found out it wasn't required to change everything just to meet the new requirements, thankfully! 
[![responsive_web_design_certificate_freecodecamp.png](https://s15.postimg.cc/7o5yjdtwr/responsive_web_design_certificate_freecodecamp.png)](https://postimg.cc/image/jd9y7ckvb/)

### Day 61: June 30, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress**: Started the ES6 lessons on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Now I finally understand WHY let and const exist, I had learned how to use them before because it was one of the requirements for the Pixel Art Maker Udacity project, but didn't know the actual reasons to use them instead of just var. Now I get it! Thanks FCC!

### Day 62: July 1, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning ES6 but got stuck on a #freecodecamp challenge: Write Higher Order Arrow Functions, will see if I can figure it out tomorrow.

### Day 63: July 2, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress**: Worked out the solution to a few of the challenges but I'm dislinking the ES6 section on #freecodecamp so far, so I'm gonna do the Udacity ES6 course instead (that I had already started). #GoingBacktoMyRoots Then I wanna start the #JavaScript30 course/challenge by Wes Bos.

### Day 64: July 3, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building

**Today's Progress**: Since Udacity's ES6 course isn't available right now for some reason. I started with Day 1 of the JavaScript30, making a [keyboard drum kit](https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/vrMGRK)!  
  - Learned about custom data selectors, the [classList](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_element_classlist.asp) property, transitionend and keycode (keycode.info) events.

**Thoughts:** Whenever I spend some time without coding with JS I forget how to do basic syntax things, the struggle is real, but I can always look up my past projects to remind myself. This course uses ES6 but so far it's applying things I already learned.

### Day 65: July 4, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: No time to be on the computer coding today so I got my phone's SoloLearn app running whenever I could. Learning ES6 through there. 

### Day 66: July 5, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress**: Didn't get much time to code again today... Learned some more ES6 features and started Day 2 of #JavaScript30 ... It'll be more like a Day 2.5 for me 'cause I really don't feel like I can complete it today without rushing it. Got started with changing some of the CSS though, like setting the clock hands in the middle (pointing at 12) using a different method than appliying the <code>transform: rotate(90deg)</code> that wes bos used.

### Day 67: July 6, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and Building

**Today's Progress & Thoughts**: Today I was planning to continue the #JavaScript30 but right in the morning, a Net Ninja video popped up on youtube and I discovered this tutorial of his ["CSS Only Dropdown Menu"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxn1x3kAyY&t=338s) which was pretty cool so I decided to try it in my [Techical Documentation Page](https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/gKKVmB) project, and also apply some of the suggestions I got from the #freecodecamp forum. So that was my day!

### Day 68: July 7, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 2 of the #JavaScriot30 challenge. https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/ZRgXXK

**Thoughts:** This was fun and challenging, applied things I had learned but forgotten how to do like setInterval, learned you can set an inline element using <code>element.style</code> and how to surpass a glitch that happened once the second hand completed a full minute. I still want to change the styling a bit and figure out how to make the clock hands different sizes but still be rotating from the same spot. 

### Day 69: July 8, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building & Learning

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the Day 2 clock. Learned that setting the element.style.property = '' resets the styling. Watched The Net Ninja videos about ES6 (short but sweet, highly recommend them), planing to watch the rest tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** For the clock, I think it would be cool to have the background image changing depending on the current hour (night/day). Already picked the pictures now to implement it...

### Day 70: July 9, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building

**Today's Progress:** Continued learning ES4 and implemented the changing backgrounds! It was easy!  https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/ZRgXXK7

By day:

### Day 71: July 10, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building

**Today's Progress:** Started Day 3 of#JavaScript30. Finished watching the Net Ninja's [ES6 youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Mp2kwE8xY0&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gKfw25slm4CUDUcM_sXdml) 

**Thoughts:** Only learnt now that Javascript runs from right to left hahah!
Remarkable things from Day 3 of #JavaScript30:
  - Cool application of the custom data selectors;
  - Learned how to set CSS properties and their correspondent values via JS by using <code>document.documentElement.style.setProperties().</code>
  
### Day 72: July 11, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building

**Today's Progress & Thoughts:** Finished Day 3 of #JavaScript30, learned how to customize the range inputs (or any inputs I guess, using <code>-webkit-appearance: none</code> to eliminate the default) Here's my rendition: https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/djPWVz 

[![Day 3 #JavaScript30](https://s15.postimg.cc/w047k77rv/Captura_de_ecr_de_2018-07-15_13-29-58.png)](https://postimg.cc/image/d7scgmbdj/)


AND started Day 4: 1st Array Cardio, one of the reasons I started this challenge. Learned a cool way to display array values in the console using <code>console.table()</code> 

### Day 73: July 12, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building
**Today's Progress & Thoughts:** Done with the Array cardio for Day 4 of #JavaScript30! It was tough but awesome to learn! Now I feel more prepared for the #Freecodecamp ES6 challenges. Started working on the Day 5, Flexbox + JavaScript Image Gallery. This design is so cool!

### Day 74: July 13, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress & Thoughts:** I didn't code much today, but I did a few challenges/duels on SoloLearn (and reviewed incorrect answers, which is a nice way to learn as well), I also watched a few videos from the Net Ninja on Object Oriented JavaScript, learned about classes in JS! And finally, enrolled on the Summer Of Code of #1millionwomentotech let's see how it goes!

### Day 75: July 14, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Just watched some Object Oriented JavaScript videos and revised a bit of flex-box. 

**Thoughts:** Today was one of those days I had various things planed and ended up not doing much of it due to little unexpected things that came up & proacastinated a bit. So ended up not completing Day 5 of #JavaScript30 and don't know if I even ended up dedicating 1h to coding as I fell asleep while watching JS videos :( Oh well... Accept failure and move on!

### Day 76: July 15, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building

**Today's Progress:** Done with Day 5 of #JavaScript30 - Flexbox and JS image Gallery! Just added some over effects. https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/WKrpPR. Started Day 6 video - Ajax Type Ahead with fetch().

**Thoughts:** This one was pretty cool. I managed to do a few things myself before watching the whole video and some of it was correct hahah. My thoughts from Day 5 to Day 6: "well that escalated quickly!" it's like night and day on difficulty level for me. It's the hardest one yet as I have never worked with Ajax or Json... But it's so cool, I will need to find other resourses to really learn this, as I'm just not getting it right now. 

### Day 77: July 16, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress:** Been studying JavaScript Promises & AJAX on Udacity.

**Thoughts:** This is all very new and exciting! 

### Day 78: July 17, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Continuing my journey to learn about the JS promises... But it's not working well for me.

**Thoughts:** Today has been a day field with self-doubt, anxiety, frustration and not a lot of progress in learning... I'm just gonna stop and come back tomorrow.

### Day 79: July 18, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress:** Coding wise, continued where I had left on and I think I understand the basics of Async JS now. A lot of meditating was done today, found some ways to deal with things at last...

**Thoughts:** Will see if I can complete (and understand) day 6 of #JavaScript30 tomorrow!
Now, I'm just gonna type out the things I have made sense of while meditating, reading and youtubing. Yep I did this whole investigation to figure my mind out and see if I could calm down my self-deprecating thoughts and anxiety regarding many things in life, things that often get in the way of my "happy coding" state as well.

 #### I need to remind myself to:     
   - Be my own best friend, I'm the most important person in my life, the only one that has always been and will be here for the rest of my life (I had never thought about this), so learn to make myself feel good, raise myself up when I say bad things to myself, be a good friend. 

   - Ask why am I stressing so much over accomplishing something, to be happy in the future, when I can be happy right now, enjoying this very moment? 
    
   - Be grateful for everything that's good in my life currently.

   - Focus on the facts, what is real right now? Can I do this? Yes, I can. Will I succeed? I don't know but I can try. 

   - Ask myself, what's so bad about these situations that I worry will happen if I do or say something?
   
   - Understand that other people's judgements say more about themselves than about me. It's none of my business what they might think of me (or about anything really).

   - Know that I can't control others. I can only control my life, my decisions, my actions.

   - Realise that I am this body & this mind at this very moment. I am NOT other people's ideas of me. I am not beautiful, ugly, nice, bad, anxious or calm. Some times I might be these things, but at other moments I'm not. These are abstract concepts and should not define me as a person. I am this nose, these legs, these hands, these eyes and they are just the way they need to be right now.

   - Get movings,exercise: do pilates and take care of my physical body, so that I can be healthier, stronger and heal. Not for other people, but for myself.

   - Go outside and be mindful of nature, shapes, colors, sounds... Apreciate them. 
    
   - Cry it out. Cry hard when I need to. It's ok to not be ok. It'll seriously make me feel better.

   - Meditate and let go.
   
### Day 80: July 19, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Udacity Async JavaScript course and continued looking at Day 6 of #JavaScript30

**Thoughts:** Didn't have much time with the computer so I didn't do what I had planed.

### Day 81: July 20, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building

**Today's Progress:** Finally finished and understood [Day 6 of #JavaScript30](https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/ejgdNQ). Learned a bit more about Regular expressions too. Continued the Udacity ES6 course (that problem I had accessing it before is now solved). And started Day 7.
Not coding related: I am done with the portrait commission I was doing for the past month hahah!

### Day 82: July 21, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building

**Today's Progress:** Finished Day 7 of #JavaScript30, this was was a piece of vegan cake! :P learned about some(), every(), find() and findIndex(). Started working on a new small project for an awesome slack group I'm part of! https://github.com/sofiabsilva/slack-users-form

### Day 83: July 22, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building

**Today's Progress & Thoughts:** Not so good. Started writing the JS code for the slack form... One of those days of researching, mostly trying to understand how to collect the data from the form and do a POST request with json. I still don't really know how to work with Asyc JS it seems.

### Day 84: July 23, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building

**Today's Progress & Thoughts:** After a good night of sleep I was able to get to work more effectively, all that research and head banging had it's positives. Today I finished up the slack form project with the help of @ZAYDEK.
I ended up using jQuery for the AJAX post request, much simpler and ended up not needing to convert the input data to a JSON strings. 

### Day 85: July 24, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building

**Today's Progress:** Started working on Day 8 of #JavaScript30 and also, since I remembered seeing the HTML5 Canvas course on Udacity I started taking it as well. It's helping me understand the basics of the canvas thing better.

### Day 86: July 25, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building

**Today's Progress:** Finished Day 8 of #JavaScript30, on top of learning some cool ways to use the HTML5 canvas, I also used text and figured out how to color it with a gradient. Added a custom rainbow pointer cursor and used a soft-light effect on the "paint".
Here it is: https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/wxqWwX

### Day 87: July 26, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Done Day 9 of #JavaScript30, learned different ways to use the chrome dev tools and logging things to the JS console. 

**Thoughts:** My favorite thing I learned was the very first, Wesbos shows how to see what's happening, javascript wise, with each DOM element!

Inspect element -> right click on the DOM element -> Break on -> attribute modifications -> click on element on the page -> goes to debugger! -> go back to Elements tab to tick off the break.

### Day 88: July 27, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress:** Started Day 10 of #JavaScript30 (checking various checkboxes while pressing shift) this is the first challenge that I'm attempting to do by myself before watching the whole video (just like Wes Bos suggested to do). I feel like I'm pretty close to the solution! 

### Day 89: July 28, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress:** I DID IT! Completed Day 10 of #JavaScript30 all by myself! Changed the colors on CSS a bit too.
https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/rrYjZB

**Thoughts:** Really happy about this and the whole process of brainstoring to solve the challenge. I'm noticing that I'm able to work with the errors I get like they're my friends, not enemies! The console and debugger are my best buddies though (also google).

### Day 90: July 29, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress:** Started and completed the required tasks on Day 11 of #JavaScript30. With this one we're making a custom HTML video player interactive with javascript, I did it mostly all by myself, only got a bit stuck when math was needed, to update the width % of the porgress bar as the video was playing. https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/bjaaYO

There are a few noteworthy things I've learned on this one... 
-  Here, instead of using an if statement, we use && .. If mousedown is false nothing will happen.
<code>progress.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => mousedown && scrub(e));</code>

- My code ended up very different than Wes'. The part that most differs is on the skip buttons, Wes Bos used a custom data attribute, and I think the code is cleaner that way, it was just not intuitive for me. Check [his solution] (https://github.com/sofiabsilva/learning-path/blob/master/JavaScript30/Day11/WesBosSolution.js).


### Day 91: July 30, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress & Thoughts:** Added the bonus feature for the HTML video player of adding a button to make it full screen. Completed [day 12](https://codepen.io/Tubbie/pen/djJjwM) of #JavaScript30, which was a basic yet fun one, to do something on the page (anything, lots of potential right?) when a certain sequence of keys is pressed. This could be fun to use for a game or just to add an easter egg to any website. Started Day 13 as well.

### Day 92: July 31, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building

**Today's Progress:** Did day 13 of #JavaScript30, learned how to make images slide in on scroll. Pretty cool one! I can see myself using this in the future (note to self: be careful not to overdo it!). I also applied my own styling to the article and found out there's a [lorem ipsum but for pictures - picsum](https://picsum.photos/). 
https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/BPYwJX
- Completed my first [Codewars kata](https://github.com/sofiabsilva/learning-path/tree/master/Codewars/kata) today too. 

### Day 93: August 1, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Day 14 of #JavaScript30 done. This one was mostly theory, to understand how references and copies work in arrays and objects.

### Day 94: August 2, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Day 15 of #JavaScript30, learned about LocalStorage and reviewed how event delegation works. I liked this one! 

**Thoughts:** Note to self: try to think of using event delegation more often!

### Day 95: August 3, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress & Thoughts:** Day 16 of #JavaScript30, learned to make a text shadow follow the mouse movements, this was something I had been wanting to learn for a while. So cool! Had a bit of trouble understanding the math, but by slowing down and breaking it all down I got it! https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/varXZE


### Day 96: August 4, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress & Thoughts:** Came up with a much longer solution to Day 17 of #JavaScript30 - Sorting band names without articles... Should have used regular expressions. Oh well, at least I did it xD
Here's the thing with Wes Bos solution commented at the end for comparison.
https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/djKEpM

- Observation: I did 2 weeks in a row of github commits! YAY
[![Captura_de_ecr_de_2018-08-04_12-54-28.png](https://s15.postimg.cc/dskxksmmj/Captura_de_ecr_de_2018-08-04_12-54-28.png)](https://postimg.cc/image/jtimhv98n/)

### Day 97: August 5, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress:** Done Day 18 of #JavaScript30 "How JavaScript's Array Reduce Works" and installed ESLint on atom, now I need to learn how to make the most out of it. 

**Thoughts:** Wes Bos explained so well the % (modulus), and I actually loved the method he used to convert seconds to hour: mins: secs. 

### Day 98: August 7, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Watched Day 19 of #JavaScript30 but didn't actually do it (I'm skipping this one - WebCam Fun) because of a youtube comment lol (this is probably not something I would need to use anytime soon so, I decided to just understand the basics and know this thing exists) But started working on Day 20 - Speech recognition. Couldn't make the local host work. So instead did some codewars hahah 

**Thoughts:** Yesterday was mu brithday so I skipped a day of coding! 

### Day 99: August 8, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Did some CodeWars once again, I'm really enjoying these, but I'm only doing the 8kyu for now. I also succeded at installing node.js and npm. Now the local host is working! But I can't seem to make the speech recognition work :( 


### DAY 100: August 9, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress** I DID IT! Today was one of those days I didn't feel like coding but pushed through some FCC and Codewars challenges! 
 **Thoughts:** So glad I got involved with this community and challenge. It really helped me to stay motivated and build the habit to code every day. That's exactly what I wanted out of it. It was very challenging at times but I learned so much thought these last 100 days! I always feel like I could have done more but I decided that I'll be happy regardless of what I've achieved each day and stop comparing my progress to other people's.
