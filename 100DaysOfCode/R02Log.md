Finished round 1 earlier this month, paused on doing coding related things just for a few days (non-consecutively), but now I feel like it's time for round 2 as I started a new course I'm super excited about! Harvard's CS50!

## Main goals for this round:
- Successfuly complete CS50; 
- Get (at least) my second FreeCodeCamp certificate;
- Finish #JavaScript30;
- Finish up my TubbieArts website and pusblish it;

### Day 1: August 23, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Finished lecture 1 of the CS50 course. Learned what compiling is! 

**Thoughts:** First contact with the C language wasn't too bad, some things are done the exact same way in JavaScript, it's really cool to learn another language, was expecting to be overwhelmed, let's see how I do with the next problem set... Fascinated about the final part of the lecture about memory Overflow. 

### Day 2: August 24, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Applying

**Today's Progress**: Started to work on problem set 1 (for week 1 of CS50), watched a few "shorts" that are a great addition to the course, where some of the concepts that were introduced in the lectures are presented in a clear manner. 

**Thoughts:** The style guide for the course is a bit different to what I use normally (udacity styleguide), mainly in terms of curly brace placement. I prefer the udacity style but won't be able to use it as these problem sets will be evaluated with their own styleguide in mind (which they say it's more readable, but maybe it's not for me just because that's the way I'm used to?) anyway, I welcome this added "challenge" with open arms. 

### Day 3: August 25, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem solving

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on problem set 1 (for week 1 of CS50), managed to solve 2 of them with help of a few "walkthroughs"

### Day 4: August 26, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem solving

**Today's Progress**: Continued Problem Set 1, Last problem is almost solved (I think).

**Thoughts:** This one is to write a program that validates any credit card number input (according to "Luhnâ€™s algorithm") and outputs if it's a mastercard, visa or american express card. It's the hardest problem yet but soooooo cool. 

### Day 5: August 27, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem solving
 
 **Today's Progress**: Completed the problem set 1 and submited all my solutions! Assisted lecture 2, per continuation of week 1.
 
 **Thoughts:** I'm so happy! Can't wait to continue being challenged like this!
