# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 Log

Read about this challenge and join in!
https://www.100daysofcode.com/

Finished round 1 earlier this month, paused on doing coding related things just for a few days (non-consecutively), but now I feel like it's time for round 2 as I started a new course I'm super excited about! Harvard's CS50!

## Main goals for this round:
- Successfuly complete CS50; 
- Get (at least) my second FreeCodeCamp certificate;
- Finish #JavaScript30;
- Finish up my TubbieArts website and pusblish it;

### Day 1: August 23, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Finished lecture 1 of the CS50 course. Learned what compiling is! 

**Thoughts:** First contact with the C language wasn't too bad, some things are done the exact same way in JavaScript, it's really cool to learn another language, was expecting to be overwhelmed, let's see how I do with the next problem set... Fascinated about the final part of the lecture about memory Overflow. 

### Day 2: August 24, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Applying

**Today's Progress**: Started to work on problem set 1 (for week 1 of CS50), watched a few "shorts" that are a great addition to the course, where some of the concepts that were introduced in the lectures are presented in a clear manner. 

**Thoughts:** The style guide for the course is a bit different to what I use normally (udacity styleguide), mainly in terms of curly brace placement. I prefer the udacity style but won't be able to use it as these problem sets will be evaluated with their own styleguide in mind (which they say it's more readable, but maybe it's not for me just because that's the way I'm used to?) anyway, I welcome this added "challenge" with open arms. 

### Day 3: August 25, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem solving

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on problem set 1 (for week 1 of CS50), managed to solve 2 of them with help of a few "walkthroughs"

### Day 4: August 26, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem solving

**Today's Progress**: Continued Problem Set 1, Last problem is almost solved (I think).

**Thoughts:** This one is to write a program that validates any credit card number input (according to "Luhn’s algorithm") and outputs if it's a mastercard, visa or american express card. It's the hardest problem yet but soooooo cool. 

### Day 5: August 27, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem solving
 
 **Today's Progress**: Completed the problem set 1 and submited all my solutions! Assisted lecture 2, per continuation of week 1.
 
 **Thoughts:** I'm so happy! Can't wait to continue being challenged like this! 
 
### Day 6: August 28, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning
 
**Today's Progress**: Watched 2 of the short segments for Week 1, continued. Learning to use the built in debugger on CS50's IDE and wrote a small function for practicing, preparing to start problem set 2!

### Day 7: August 29, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Watched some more shorts, learned about using constants, arrays and command-line arguments in C. Started planing my code for the first problem of Pset2. Cryptography! Love this.  

### Day 8: August 30, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress & Thoughts:** I don't know why today I've been anxious all day, might be because I didn't get enough sleep and therefore wasn't as productive. Trying to continue with Pset2 wasn't very wise. I spent a lot of time thinking about how to solve it before watching the walkthrough but finally gave in and now I understand that the problem is much more complex than I was making it xD At least now I have a better direction on how to solve it.

### Day 9: August 31, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Continuing to work on CS50. Submitted "caesar.c", a Program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher. Started the second problem on this Pset2.

### Day 10: September 1, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Completed the second problem of Pset2, a program that encrypts messages using the "Vigenère cipher". Now onto the hardest one of the bunch... 

### Day 11: September 2, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Kinda sorta DID IT. The last problem for Pset2 was to write a program that discovers the passwords based on a given hash code with the crypt() function. Took me a day and a half to figure out how to do it.
But I don't think my solution is good. Cracking some simple passwords was fast (up to three letters) but after that it takes a lot of time. Using nested for loops probably isn't the most efficient way to solve the problem? I think I'll get back to this one later on if I figure out a better way to do it.  

### Day 12: September 3, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Spent a few hours on FCC, continuing the RegExp challenges.

### Day 13: September 4, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Regular Expressions section and also the the debugging section.

### Day 14: September 5, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Assisted lecture 3 (week 2) of CS50!  

### Day 15: September 6, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Continuing with lecture 3 and some of the short additional videos. Studying Computational Complexibility and algorithms.

### Day 16: September 7, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Done with the shorts for this week, got a deeper understanding on recursive functions and how to choose what algorithms to use, now onto Pset3.

### Day 17: September 8, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Learning to read Music?

**Today's Progress:** Started the data structures basics on FCC and the CS50's Pset3, there's a lot to grasp on this one. Frist of all I'm learning to read music hahah

### Day 18: September 9, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Continuing Pset3, this one is gonna be hard.

### Day 19: September 10, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Continuing Pset3. 

**Thoughts:** Just realised I won't be finishing this course by the end of this second round of #100DaysofCode, with my current pace, specially since the problems keep getting harder. I hadn't even thought about the time it would take me, just thought for sure 100 days would be more than enough but there's no way.

### Day 20: September 11, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Did some freecodecamp data structures challenges.
