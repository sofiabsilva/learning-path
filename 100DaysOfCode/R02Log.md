# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 Log

Read about this challenge and join in!
https://www.100daysofcode.com/

Finished round 1 earlier this month, paused on doing coding related things just for a few days (non-consecutively), but now I feel like it's time for round 2 as I started a new course I'm super excited about! Harvard's CS50!

## Main goals for this round:
- Successfuly complete CS50; 
- Get (at least) my second FreeCodeCamp certificate;
- Finish #JavaScript30;
- Finish up my TubbieArts website and pusblish it;

### Day 1: August 23, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Finished lecture 1 of the CS50 course. Learned what compiling is! 

**Thoughts:** First contact with the C language wasn't too bad, some things are done the exact same way in JavaScript, it's really cool to learn another language, was expecting to be overwhelmed, let's see how I do with the next problem set... Fascinated about the final part of the lecture about memory Overflow. 

### Day 2: August 24, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Applying

**Today's Progress**: Started to work on problem set 1 (for week 1 of CS50), watched a few "shorts" that are a great addition to the course, where some of the concepts that were introduced in the lectures are presented in a clear manner. 

**Thoughts:** The style guide for the course is a bit different to what I use normally (udacity styleguide), mainly in terms of curly brace placement. I prefer the udacity style but won't be able to use it as these problem sets will be evaluated with their own styleguide in mind (which they say it's more readable, but maybe it's not for me just because that's the way I'm used to?) anyway, I welcome this added "challenge" with open arms. 

### Day 3: August 25, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem solving

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on problem set 1 (for week 1 of CS50), managed to solve 2 of them with help of a few "walkthroughs"

### Day 4: August 26, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem solving

**Today's Progress**: Continued Problem Set 1, Last problem is almost solved (I think).

**Thoughts:** This one is to write a program that validates any credit card number input (according to "Luhn’s algorithm") and outputs if it's a mastercard, visa or american express card. It's the hardest problem yet but soooooo cool. 

### Day 5: August 27, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem solving
 
 **Today's Progress**: Completed the problem set 1 and submited all my solutions! Assisted lecture 2, per continuation of week 1.
 
 **Thoughts:** I'm so happy! Can't wait to continue being challenged like this! 
 
### Day 6: August 28, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning
 
**Today's Progress**: Watched 2 of the short segments for Week 1, continued. Learning to use the built in debugger on CS50's IDE and wrote a small function for practicing, preparing to start problem set 2!

### Day 7: August 29, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Watched some more shorts, learned about using constants, arrays and command-line arguments in C. Started planing my code for the first problem of Pset2. Cryptography! Love this.  

### Day 8: August 30, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress & Thoughts:** I don't know why today I've been anxious all day, might be because I didn't get enough sleep and therefore wasn't as productive. Trying to continue with Pset2 wasn't very wise. I spent a lot of time thinking about how to solve it before watching the walkthrough but finally gave in and now I understand that the problem is much more complex than I was making it xD At least now I have a better direction on how to solve it.

### Day 9: August 31, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Continuing to work on CS50. Submitted "caesar.c", a Program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher. Started the second problem on this Pset2.

### Day 10: September 1, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Completed the second problem of Pset2, a program that encrypts messages using the "Vigenère cipher". Now onto the hardest one of the bunch... 

### Day 11: September 2, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Kinda sorta DID IT. The last problem for Pset2 was to write a program that discovers the passwords based on a given hash code with the crypt() function. Took me a day and a half to figure out how to do it.
But I don't think my solution is good. Cracking some simple passwords was fast (up to three letters) but after that it takes a lot of time. Using nested for loops probably isn't the most efficient way to solve the problem? I think I'll get back to this one later on if I figure out a better way to do it.  

### Day 12: September 3, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Spent a few hours on FCC, continuing the RegExp challenges.

### Day 13: September 4, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FCC Regular Expressions section and also the the debugging section.

### Day 14: September 5, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Assisted lecture 3 (week 2) of CS50!  

### Day 15: September 6, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Continuing with lecture 3 and some of the short additional videos. Studying Computational Complexibility and algorithms.

### Day 16: September 7, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Done with the shorts for this week, got a deeper understanding on recursive functions and how to choose what algorithms to use, now onto Pset3.

### Day 17: September 8, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Learning to read Music?

**Today's Progress:** Started the data structures basics on FCC and the CS50's Pset3, there's a lot to grasp on this one. Frist of all I'm learning to read music hahah

### Day 18: September 9, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Continuing Pset3, this one is gonna be hard.

### Day 19: September 10, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Continuing Pset3. 

**Thoughts:** Just realised I won't be finishing this course by the end of this second round of #100DaysofCode, with my current pace, specially since the problems keep getting harder. I hadn't even thought about the time it would take me, just thought for sure 100 days would be more than enough but there's no way.

### Day 20: September 11, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Did some freecodecamp data structures challenges. 
Not sure if I managed to get an hour today...

### Day 21: September 12, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Completed Pset3! Making music with code... This blew my mind a little bit! 

### Day 22: September 13, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** CS50 continued: Assisted the 4th lecture and shorts with explanations of Call Stacks (really undestood how recursion works with this) and Pointers.

**Thoughts:** This lesson and videos made me go Aha! many times, there were so many things covered here that I had been seeing for a bit but not understanding them fully. All my love to the professor David J. Malan and Doug Lloyd who explain things so amazingly well.

### Day 23: September 14, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** CS50 continued: watched shorts with explanations of Dynamic Memory Allocation, File Pointers and Hexadecimal system. Started looking into Pset4. 

### Day 24: September 15, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Trying to figure out answers for questions in Pset4. Learning about what files are really composed of and understanding how a copy of a file is made (confusing as of now) . 

### Day 25: September 16, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Answered the remaining questions I had for the first part of the problem now onto making a program that will allow me to figure out "Whodunit" by revealing a hidden message in a BMP.

### Day 26: September 17, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** FreeCodeCamp day! Continuing with Basic Data Structures, most things are revision. 

**Thoughts:** Probably gonna have to miss a day tomorrow because I'll be travelling and away all day, probably no internet connection for soloLearn but we'll see.

### Day 27: September 19, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Figured out whodunit! Started working on the next problem: resize a BMP image.

**Thoughts:** Yesterday I tried using soloLearn to code by my phone couldn't handle the code playground :( I was trying to solve my first challenge in the C language outside of CS50.

### Day 28: September 20, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Continuing the resize program, from Pset4. 

**Thoughts:** I spent so long trying to solve a problem I didn't have on this program, what a small distraction/misinterpretation can do... 
Oh and my laptop's wifi is driving me crazy, my connection keeps failing without any apparent reason :(

### Day 29: September 21, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** I did it!!!!!!!!!! Succesfully wrote a program that enlarges a bmp file. One more problem to be done with this Pset!

**Thoughts:** This was a very tough one, hardest one yet. There were many things to learn and really understand to make it work. But I feel very acomplished now that I got it to work and understand everything! 

### Day 30: September 22, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Working on the inital process of solving the last problem on CS50's Pset4, the "Recover" program. This one is really cool, it will be recovering deleted JPEG images from a memory card image!

### Day 31: September 23, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress & Thoughts:** CS50 ide isn't working properly all day and I've been trying to debug my code for this Recover program. Which I feel like I'm almost done with. It's so frustrating I can't test it already!

### Day 32: September 24, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Problem Solving

**Today's Progress & Thoughts:** Since the CS50 IDE is still not responding/loading my file, I'm gonna give it a day to rest and fix itself - Already e-mailed the cloud9 support to see if they can do anything to help my case. Hopefully I can keep going with the Pset4 tomorrow and submit it! Fingers crossed. Meanwhile, I finished the basic data structures FCC challenges and am now working on the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges (I've been eager to start these).

### Day 33: September 25, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Continued doing the basic Algorithm challenges on FCC.

### Day 34: September 26, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** More algorithms on FCC and no response from CS50 or Cloud 9 staff yet.  

### Day 35: September 27, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving
**Today's Progress:** Spent hours doing one algorithm challenge. And finally understood how to get my CS50 IDE to work again :D I had created too many jpgs accidently with the recover program while debugging.

### Day 36: September 28, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving & Learning

**Today's Progress:** Spent hours with one algorithm again, but hey I completed the whole section! On to Object Oriented Programming on FCC. Fixed the "CS50 ide" problem!

### Day 37: September 29, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** I'm finally able to work on the CS50 Recover program, and after a bunch of tries and chaning up my code I finally recovered the pictures :') They all show up correctly (from what I can see at least) but my code doesn't pass one of the check50 tests. FML. Already posted my code to reddit and waiting for someone to shed some light... I really don't get why it's not passing. 
- Update! Got it, asking for help on reddit was a good idea :) Pset4 is now submitted. 

### Day 38: September 30, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Watched CS50's Lecture 5, for week 4. Reviewing/deeper dive on concepts learned through practice and the shorts for week 3 (structs, memory allocation, buffers). Also learning about data structures, stacks and queues (where the stack overflow name comes from!).

### Day 39: October 1, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress & Thoughts:** Continued lecture 5 and started watching the shorts, I couldn't finish the lecture yesterday because I kept pausing and lowering the speed to try understanding things better. There were some concepts here that were quite difficult to get but I'm sure with the help of the rest of the material (like the notes, shorts and Pset5 itself) I'm gonna be fine! Using structures and linked lists of nodes were the most challenging for me to understand. 

### Day 40: October 2, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Watched some of the shorts for week 4. Deeper look at Structures, linked-lists and hash tables.

### Day 41: October 3, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Completed the shorts material for week 4. Learning more about stacks, tries, queues and the ways of  manipulating them. This is definitely going to be a long week (+).

### Day 42: October 4, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Prepping

**Today's Progress:** Read the source code Pset5, spell checker and started answering some questions.

### Day 43: October 5, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Answering Questions & Prepping

**Today's Progress:** Completed the questions for Pset5. Started thinking about how to solve the problem itself.

### Day 44: October 6, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Sort of loosing my mind with this Pset... I feel like this is going to take forever. But oh well, selected a hash function to use for the dictionary and started writing some code with the help of the walkthrough, but I don't feel confortable at all with it. Let the debugging begin.

### Day 45: October 7, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Didn't make much progress. Just trying to figure things out but my code still doesn't compile... I think the issue is that I'm not understanding pointers and file pointers well enough. Gotta go back and re-read and re-watch material to see if any lightbulb goes off...

### Day 46: October 8, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Finally was able to compile the code sucessfully... That's about it as far as progress goes.

### Day 47: October 9, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving & Learning

**Today's Progress & Thoughts:** I'm so lost- The code is still super buggy (for the Load() function) and I'm not sure how to make it work. To clear up my mind I continued with the Object Oriented Programming part on FCC.

### Day 48: October 10, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress:** Continued learning Object Oriented Programming on FCC.

### Day 49: October 11, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Got some courage back to continue with Pset5, I finally figured out what my "problem" was with the `load()` function, the problem is that I thought the dictionary I was using had all the words in my text and it actually only had 2 of them, which was what I was getting when running the code. So it was correct! I'm not working on the `check()` function.

### Day 50: October 12, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** Already halfway!! 
So, looks like my `check()` implementation works! But after writing code for `unload()` and running valgrind there appears to be a problem when running it with the large (full) dictionary. Looks like I'm trying to use 8 bytes of memory (I think it's a pointer) that I shouldn't be. But I don't understand why! So after getting stuck again, Free Code Camp is my friend (finishing up the section for object oriented js). 

### Day 51: October 13, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Problem Solving

**Today's Progress:** absolutely stuck all day. Not much progress. Ended up posting on reddit for some clues on how to get the unload() function to work.
