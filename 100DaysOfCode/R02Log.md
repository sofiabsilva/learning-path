Finished round 1 earlier this month, paused on doing coding related things just for a few days (non-consecutively), but now I feel like it's time for round 2. 

## Main goals for this round:
- Successfuly complete CS50; 
- Get (at least) my second FreeCodeCamp certificate;
- Finish #JavaScript30;
- Finish up my TubbieArts website and pusblish it;

### Day 1: August 23, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Finished lecture 1 of the CS50 course. Learned what compiling is! 

**Thoughts:** First contact with the C language wasn't too bad, some things are done the exact same way in JavaScript. Fascinated about the final part of the lecture about memory Overflow.
