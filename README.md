:mortar_board: This repo is to keep track of all the courses I've done, and my progress to become a web developer

# November 2017 - February 2018
- Started the Google Challenge Scholership - Front-End track on Udacity. I had no previous programming knowledge, applied to the scholarship after receiving an e-mail by Google recommending it, at this time I was thinking of making a website to display my artwork so I figured, why not? During the duration of the course, I fell in love with programming and now plan to make it career.

# Currently
  - Continuing the [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge
  - Learning Regular Expressions on FreeCodeCamp
  - Doing the Harvard CS50's Introduction to Computer Science on EdX. It's been reccomended to me, and I needed something to get excited about right now, so there we go! I hope it's not too much to be learning intermediate/advanced JS and other languages that will be taught like C and Python at the same time... We'll see, if it's too much I'll pause it and continue focusing on JS.

      ### CS50
      - [x] Week 0: Loved the first lecture and already got to learn about a bunch of conceps, like what Binary and ASCII are actually. For the 1st problem set (actually Pset0) I made this little Harry Potter game (of course) ["Survive the Dementors"](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/239435007/) using Scratch! I wish I would have found this programming language as a kid...
      
      - [ ] Week 1: Introduction to C is going well! Learned about compiling, memory overflow and the C syntax. Some of the Pset1 problems were challenging, specially the last one in which I had to write a program that would get a credit card number input and output if the card is valid and the CC company it belongs to. Very cool stuff! Gimmie more!
