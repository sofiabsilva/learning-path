# learning-path
:mortar_board: This repo is to keep track of all the courses I've done, and my progress to become a web developer

# November 2017 - February 2018
- Started the Google Challenge Scholership - Front-End track on Udacity. I had no previous programming knowledge, applied to the scholarship after receiving an e-mail by Google recommending it, at this time I was thinking of making a website to display my artwork so I figured, why not? During the duration of the course, I fell in love with programming and now plan to make it career.

   ## Projects and Skills aquired
   - HTML - [Mockup Article project](https://sofiabsilva.github.io/html-mockup-article/)

# March 2018
- While with Udacity I had started taking lessons on the SoloLearn mobile app, a way to keep learning and revising material while away from the computer. I finished the courses "HTML Fundamentals" and "JavaScript" and did a few challenges. 

- Even though I didn't get the full nanodegreee I kept doing their free courses to complement what I had learned.

   - On August 9th finished the #100DaysOfCode challenge, where I've posted on [this](https://github.com/sofiabsilva/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) repo about what I've been doing each day and also [tweeting](https://twitter.com/TubbieHead) about my thoughts and progress with the challenge hashtag. 
     - Continued [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/). It's been paused on Day 17 though
     - Learning Regular Expressions on FreeCodeCamp
     - Started Harvard's CS50 course on Edx (progress bellow)!
     - On August 23rd I started the 2nd round of #100DaysOfCode, I'm logging my progress [here](https://github.com/sofiabsilva/learning-path/blob/master/100DaysOfCode/R02Log.md). Not so much on twitter this time to see if I can manage my time better... Social media = Time sucker. But good for connecting... Let's see how this round goes.
   
   ## Projects and Skills aquired
   - [Local Storage and Event Delegation](https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/MBXazo)
   - [Shadow Following Mouse](https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/varXZE)

   - Learning the C language and Computer Science basics
      
# Currently
  - #100DaysOfCode round 2.
  - Debugging, Basic Data Structures and Basic Algorithms on FreeCodeCamp
  - Doing the Harvard CS50's Introduction to Computer Science on EdX. It's been reccomended to me, and I needed something to get excited about right now, so there we go! I hope it's not too much to be learning intermediate/advanced JS and other languages that will be taught like C and Python at the same time... We'll see, if it's too much I'll pause it and continue focusing on JS.
   
      ### CS50
      - [x] Week 0: Loved the first lecture and already got to learn about a bunch of conceps, like what Binary and ASCII are actually.
         - **Pset0**: For the 1st problem set I made this little Harry Potter game (of course) ["Survive the Dementors"](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/239435007/) using Scratch! I wish I would have found this programming language as a kid...
      
      - [x] Week 1: Introduction to C! Also learned about compiling and memory overflow. In the 2nd lecture, there was a lot about arrays and cryptography.
         - **Pset1**: Some of the Pset1 problems were challenging, specially the last one in which I had to write a program that would get a credit card number input and output if the card is valid and the CC company it belongs to. Very cool stuff! Gimmie more!
         - **Pset2**: Cryptography problems. pretty cool ones! The most challenging one was to figure out how to crack passwords (I did it but surely not using the best method. Hopefully will learn a better way to do it in future lessons).
      
      - [x] Week 2 : Computational Complexibility and algorithms. Recursive functions are a whole new world.
          - **Pset3**: Learned to read music and write a program that takes machine readable notes to actually make music with code. We had source code for this one, a lot of things to understand before starting to convert the musical notes to frequencies and synthetise the music. This blew my mind a little bit!
          
      - [x] Week 3 : Pointers and file pointers, dynamic memory allocation, call stacks, the hexadecimal system, what image files are and how they stay in memory after deletion - Intro to Digital forensics!
         - **Pset4**: Digital forensics problems and image manipulation.Learned a lot about custom structures and data types and file pointers with this Pset. It was so hard but rewarding. We had to manipulate a BMP image to discover "whodunit" a hidden phrase in a image full of red pixels. Figure out how to resize an image and recover deleted jpgs from a memory card. 
         
      - [x] Week 4 : How to work with huge ammounts of data - Hashtables (with linked lists), Tries. More on data structures, custom types, stacks and queues. 
         - **Pset5**: Spell checking, using memory allocated dictionary (implementing a load() function), checking whether the words in a text exist in that dictionary, and do it fast! Then unloading the dictionary from memory (and avoiding memory leaks). This one was so hard! Took me a long time to understand how a hashtable, an array of linked lists worked, coding wise. I was understanding the theory but couldn't put it into code correctly when implementing the load() function. I had some help from reddit, a few clues made me rethink my reasoning and finally - no more memory problems.
         
      - [x] Week 5 : Starting to go into the internet world! Internet Primer, IP addressess,  TCP, HTTP and Web development intro.
      - [x] Week 6 : A different professor (from Yale this time) taught Dynamic Programming and Network routing. This lecture was a bit hard on my brain but looked up some outside material to understand the dynamic programming concepts a little bit better. The second half of week 6 was the Python Basics class.
      
      - [x] Week 7 : Python continued. Learned about servers and how to use python and Flask in Web development.
         - **Pset6**: The challenges were to write the same programs that we had written in ealier Psets for C this time in Python. And "similarities" which is also written in python and used to compare two files submited via a web form (html page) using a chosen algorithm: Compare lines, sentences and substrings of n. I found this Pset easier, it was basically just reading python documentation which was really helpful and easy to understand.
         
      - [ ] Week 8 : in progress
      - [ ] Week 9
      - [ ] Week 10
      - [ ] Week 11
