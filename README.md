:mortar_board: This repo is to keep track of all the courses I've done, and my progress to become a web developer

# November 2017 - February 2018
- Started the Google Challenge Scholership - Front-End track on Udacity. I had no previous programming knowledge, applied to the scholarship after receiving an e-mail by Google recommending it, at this time I was thinking of making a website to display my artwork so I figured, why not? During the duration of the course, I fell in love with programming and now plan to make it career.

# Currently
   - I've been logging on [this](https://github.com/sofiabsilva/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) repo about what I've been doing each day for the #100DaysOfCode, I'm also [tweeting](https://twitter.com/TubbieHead) about my thoughts and progress with the challenge hashtag. 
   - Learning ES6
   - Doing the [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course/challenge, my goal is to do a project each day (clearly not realistic) but also apply my own styles and try new things with CSS as well.
