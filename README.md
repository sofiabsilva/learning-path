:mortar_board: This repo is to keep track of all the courses I've done, and my progress to become a web developer

# November 2017 - February 2018
- Started the Google Challenge Scholership - Front-End track on Udacity. I had no previous programming knowledge, applied to the scholarship after receiving an e-mail by Google recommending it, at this time I was thinking of making a website to display my artwork so I figured, why not? During the duration of the course, I fell in love with programming and plan to make it career.

- While with Udacity I had started taking lessons on the SoloLearn mobile app, a way to keep learning and revising material while away from the computer. I finished the courses "HTML Fundamentals" and "JavaScript" and did a few challenges. 

- Even though I didn't get the full nanodegreee I kept doing their free courses to complement what I had learned.
