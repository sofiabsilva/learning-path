This repo is to keep track of all the courses I've done 

# November 2017 - February 2018
- Started the Google Challenge Scholership - Front-End track on Udacity. I had no previous programming knowledge, applied to the scholarship after receiving an e-mail by Google recommending it, at this time I was thinking of making a website to display my artwork so I figured, why not? During the duration of the course, I fell in love with programming and plan to make it career.
