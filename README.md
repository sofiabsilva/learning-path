# Learning Path
:mortar_board: This repo is to keep track of all the courses I've done, and my progress to become a web developer

# November 2017 - February 2018
- Started the Google Challenge Scholership - Front-End track on Udacity. I had no previous programming knowledge, applied to the scholarship after receiving an e-mail by Google recommending it, at this time I was thinking of making a website to display my artwork so I figured, why not? During the duration of the course, I fell in love with programming and now plan to make it my career.

# November 2018

   - Went to WebSummit in Lisbon at the beginning of the month. I almost didn't go due to personal reasons, but I pushed through and had a great inspiring week out there.
   - Continued working through the CS50 last problem sets, used Python/Flask & Jinja for developing interactive web apps and also learned the basics of databases with SQL.  
   
# December 2018

  - Completed the Harvard CS50's Introduction to Computer Science on EdX! It was such a great course/experience. So glad I did it. I have become more comfortable with problem solving, I'm now confident that, even though it might be hard or look impossible at first, I can definitely do it if I don't give up... There's no reason to doubt myself and get super frustrated, just open up a text file and figure out the small steps I'll need to take to get to the bigger ones and so on. It gave me the ability to learn new languages, it's not that hard once you know the basics as they're all pretty similar, I also became more experienced with the command line and git.
  - While working on my final project I discovered a cool tool to use when you want to visualise JSON files (specially complex ones): https://beautifier.io/
  
   ## Projects and Skills aquired
   - Got more comfortable with using APIs
   - Learned how to build a chrome extension for my final project.
   - [Presentation of my final project: "Groove Radio Chrome Extension"](https://youtu.be/2XLHLEMcHtI) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sofiabsilva/radio-chrome-extension)
   
 ### CS50 Course
   <details>
   <summary>See Progress Log</h3></summary>
   
   - [x] Week 0: Loved the first lecture and already got to learn about a bunch of conceps, like what Binary and ASCII are actually.
      - **Pset0**: For the 1st problem set I made this little Harry Potter game (of course) ["Survive the Dementors"](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/239435007/) using Scratch! I wish I would have found this programming language as a kid...

   - [x] Week 1: Introduction to C! Also learned about compiling and memory overflow. In the 2nd lecture, there was a lot about arrays and cryptography.
      - **Pset1**: Some of the Pset1 problems were challenging, specially the last one in which I had to write a program that would get a credit card number input and output if the card is valid and the CC company it belongs to. Very cool stuff! Gimmie more!
      - **Pset2**: Cryptography problems. pretty cool ones! The most challenging one was to figure out how to crack passwords (I did it but surely not using the best method. Hopefully will learn a better way to do it in future lessons).

   - [x] Week 2 : Computational Complexibility and algorithms. Recursive functions are a whole new world.
       - **Pset3**: Learned to read music and write a program that takes machine readable notes to actually make music with code. We had source code for this one, a lot of things to understand before starting to convert the musical notes to frequencies and synthetise the music. This blew my mind a little bit!

   - [x] Week 3 : Pointers and file pointers, dynamic memory allocation, call stacks, the hexadecimal system, what image files are and how they stay in memory after deletion - Intro to Digital forensics!
      - **Pset4**: Digital forensics problems and image manipulation.Learned a lot about custom structures and data types and file pointers with this Pset. It was so hard but rewarding. We had to manipulate a BMP image to discover "whodunit" a hidden phrase in a image full of red pixels. Figure out how to resize an image and recover deleted jpgs from a memory card. 

   - [x] Week 4 : How to work with huge ammounts of data - Hashtables (with linked lists), Tries. More on data structures, custom types, stacks and queues. 
      - **Pset5**: Spell checking, using memory allocated dictionary (implementing a load() function), checking whether the words in a text exist in that dictionary, and do it fast! Then unloading the dictionary from memory (and avoiding memory leaks). This one was so hard! Took me a long time to understand how a hashtable, an array of linked lists worked, coding wise. I was understanding the theory but couldn't put it into code correctly when implementing the load() function. I had some help from reddit, a few clues made me rethink my reasoning and finally - no more memory problems.

   - [x] Week 5 : Starting to go into the internet world! Internet Primer, IP addressess,  TCP, HTTP and Web development intro.
   - [x] Week 6 : A different professor (from Yale this time) taught Dynamic Programming and Network routing. This lecture was a bit hard on my brain but looked up some outside material to understand the dynamic programming concepts a little bit better. The second half of week 6 was the Python Basics class.

   - [x] Week 7 : Python continued. Learned about servers and how to use python and Flask in Web development.
      - **Pset6**: The challenges were to write the same programs that we had written in ealier Psets for C this time in Python. And "similarities" which is also written in python and used to compare two files submited via a web form (html page) using a chosen algorithm: Compare lines, sentences and substrings of n. I found this Pset easier, it was basically just reading python documentation which was really helpful and easy to understand.

   - [x] Week 8 : Time for introduction to databases with SQL.
       - **Pset7**: CS50 Finance, a web site where the user can register and log in, consult stocks quotes (real time - using an API) and "buy"/"sell" stocks' shares. This was actually one of my favorite problem sets, really enjoyed the database interaction and learning how the back end of websites is done. 

   - [x] Week 9 : Javascript and jQuery's Ajax. 
        - **Pset8**: Using google maps API and asynchronous javascript to make a web app where we can search for locations around the US by city name, state or postal-code or simply by looking around the map and clicking on markers, where a info box pops up with 10 news links (through a google news rss) for that location. This one had a lot of components that were rather complicated, but worth it!

   - [x] Week 10 : nothing this week hahah
   - [x] Week 11 : Final Project - Groove Radio Chrome Extension
        - I chose to do a chrome extension, learn the rules and design and implement user interfaces, in this case for ["Groove Radio PT"](https://grooveradiopt.com/) my dad's online radio. 
        - Here's the [youtube video link](https://youtu.be/2XLHLEMcHtI) where I present the extension's features.
        - Published the extension on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/groove-radio-pt/aadficocbpaijelnmdkhjdkfdnikggka?hl=pt-PT).
