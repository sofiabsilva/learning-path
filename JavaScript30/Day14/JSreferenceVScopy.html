    let age2 = age;

    console.log(age, age2); // 200 100

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3]= "Lux";
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const team2 = players.slice(); //slice doesn't change the original, it copies the array.
    team2[0]= "Sofia";
    console.log(team2);
    console.log(players) //stays the same

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players); //creates new empty array and concatonates the players array to it.

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[4] = "whoohooo";
    console.log(team4, players);

    //or
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(captain, person ) // person number is now 99.
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 100});
    console.log(cap2, person);

    // object ...spread (it already works now!)
    const cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.number = 20;
    console.log(cap3, person);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

  name: 'Wes',
